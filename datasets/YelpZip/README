- calc_features.py: a helper python file that includes methods to calculate features for nodes of the graph. Use/develop as a library

- create_medium.py: to create a medium sized dataset to train/test on. Takes a portion of the data in the directory `raw/`

- create_master.py: to create a master file that we can use for creating the .mat graph files for GDN/Meta-GDN to use

- deepwalk/: directory that contains the code for running the Deep Walk baseline method

- graph.txt: pickle file that represents the graph. load from pickle and use it as a networkx object

- make_graph.py: constructs the graph as saves it as a pickle file called 'graph.txt'

- medium_raw/: directory that contains a medium amount of data from `raw/` so that the code works in a short time and is still representative of the behavior

- node2vec/: directory that contains the code for running the node2vec baseline method

- raw/: directory that contains ALL of the raw data

- README: file that contains a breakdown of all the files in the directory

- small_raw/: directory that contains a very, very small subset of the data just to test any pandas functionality with


How to run DPLAN:
- Create your dataset by using create_medium.py
- Create a graph out of your dataset by using make_graph.py (this will internally use calc_features.py)
- Create embeddings out of your graph using mod_node2vec.py (copy this python file into your data directory) - at the end, you should have final_embeddings.csv and test_final_embeddings.csv
- Create .mat graph files by:
	- creating the master file using create_master.py
	- downloading the master file and running preprocessing.py locally
	- uploading the .mat files to DPLAN-Implementation/graphs and calling the folder "yelp/"
- Change the directory names in main.py in DPLAN-Implementation/ and run main.py
